      <h3>Hello! I'm <span>Dorji Wangmo</span></h3>
      <p class="tagline">ðŸŒ¸ A curious learner and book lover ðŸŒ¸</p>
      
      <p>
        I was born on May 19, 2005, and I love discovering new ideas through books, 
        movies, and meaningful conversations. Poetry and classic literature inspire me deeply, 
        while classic movies fascinate me with their timeless stories and artistic beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading has always been my favorite escape helping me imagine, learn, and connect with 
        different perspectives. I enjoy exploring stories that broaden my understanding of life 
        and spark creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I value kindness, honesty, and lifelong learning. While I enjoy spending time 
        with others, I also love quiet moments indoors reading, reflecting, or engaging in thoughtful 
        conversations, especially about history.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dream is to grow as a teacher and a person, inspiring others just as I have been inspired 
        by books, people, and art.
